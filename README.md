This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving unexpected type coercion with the + operator.  The `bug.js` file shows the problem, where adding numbers and strings using + results in string concatenation rather than numerical addition. The `bugSolution.js` file offers solutions to avoid this issue and shows how to ensure numerical addition instead of string concatenation.  This example highlights the importance of type checking or explicit type conversion in JavaScript to prevent subtle and hard-to-find errors.
